    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>1. Taking the Red Pill</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 172
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Kind of cruel, in a way— but what do you expect from natural selection? Its job is to build machines that spread genes, and if that means programming some measure of illusion into the machines, then illusion there will be.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 190
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being ruled by them.”</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>5. The Alleged Nonexistence of Your Self</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 985
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Engagement” refers, rather, to a stronger connection between consciousness and the other aggregates. Engagement is the product of a “lust,” as the Buddha puts it, that people have for the aggregates; there is a clinging to them, a possessive relationship to them. In other words, the “engagement” persists so long as the person fails to realize that the aggregates are “not-self.” The person clings to emotions, thoughts, and other elements of the aggregates as if they were personal belongings. But they’re not.†</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 990
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>liberation consists of changing the relationship between your consciousness and the things you normally think of as its “contents”— your feelings, your thoughts, and so on. Once you realize that these things are “not-self,” the relationship of your consciousness to them becomes more like contemplation than engagement, and your consciousness is liberated. And the “you” that remains— the you that, in that first discourse on the not-self, the Buddha depicts as liberated— is this liberated consciousness. I</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1053
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>As we saw in chapter 2, feelings are designed by natural selection to represent judgments about things, evaluations of them; natural selection “wants” you to experience things as either good or bad. The Buddha believed that the less you judge things— including the contents of your mind— the more clearly you’ll see them, and the less deluded you’ll be.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1098
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Still, amid all the disagreement over what the Buddha said and what the Buddha meant, there are some themes that everyone agrees are part of the Buddhist tradition from early on. And one of these is that our conception of our selves is, at best, wildly off the mark. We associate the self with control and with firm persistence through time, but on close inspection we turn out to be much less under control, and much more fluid, with a much less fixed identity, than we think.</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>6. Your CEO Is MIA</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1142
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>So if the conscious mind isn’t in control, what is in control? As we’ll see, the answer may be: nothing in particular. The closer we look at the mind, the more it seems to consist of a lot of different players, players that sometimes collaborate but sometimes fight for control, with victory going to the one that is in some sense the strongest. In other words, it’s a jungle in there, and you’re not the king of the jungle. The good news is that, paradoxically, realizing you’re not king can be the first step toward getting some real power.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1197
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Questions about how in control the conscious mind really is have now been raised from a lot of experimental angles. In a famous series of experiments first done in the early 1980s by Benjamin Libet, researchers monitored the brains of subjects while they “chose” to initiate an action. The researchers concluded that the brain was initiating the action before the person became aware of “deciding” to initiate it.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1205
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>So if you’re a Buddhist philosopher, you may feel vindicated. But you may also feel puzzled. Why would natural selection design a brain that leaves people deluded about themselves? One answer is that if we believe something about ourselves, that will help us convince other people to believe it. And certainly it’s to our benefit— or, more precisely, it would have been to the benefit of the genes of our hunter-gatherer ancestors— to convince the world that we’re coherent, consistent actors who have things under control.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1214
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>In short, from natural selection’s point of view, it’s good for you to tell a coherent story about yourself, to depict yourself as a rational, self-aware actor. So whenever your actual motivations aren’t accessible to the part of your brain that communicates with the world, it would make sense for that part of your brain to generate stories about your motivation.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1241
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Our egocentric biases are aided and abetted by the way memory works. Though certain painful events get seared into our memories— perhaps so we can avoid repeating the mistakes that led to them— we are on balance more likely to remember events that reflect favorably on us than those that don’t. And we remember positive experiences in greater detail than negative experiences, as if the positive events are specially primed for sharing with the public in rich detail. No such asymmetry of narrative detail is found in our memory of positive and negative things that happen to other people.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1245
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>What’s more, when we recount an experience to someone, the act of recounting it changes the memory of it. So if we reshape the story a bit each time— omitting inconvenient facts, exaggerating convenient ones— we can, over time, transform our actual belief about what happened. Which presumably makes it easier to convince others that our story is true.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1270
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>If the conscious self isn’t a CEO, directing all the behavior it thinks it’s directing, how does behavior get directed? How do decisions get made? An increasingly common answer within the field of psychology, especially evolutionary psychology, is that the mind is “modular.” In this view, your mind is composed of lots of specialized modules— modules for sizing up situations and reacting to them— and it’s the interplay among these modules that shapes your behavior. And much of this interplay happens without conscious awareness on your part.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1328
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>The capacity for feeling, and for subjective experience in general, is what gives life meaning and what gives valence to moral questions. If you imagine a planet full of humanlike robots, incapable of subjective experience, would there be anything obviously wrong about destroying them, or anything obviously good about creating more of them?</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>7. The Mental Modules That Run Your Life</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1499
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>It may seem that such illusions aren’t worth getting up in arms about. What’s wrong with men and women indulging in self-delusion in the course of trying to impress each other? Nothing, I guess. Some illusions are harmless, and some are even beneficial. Far be it from me to try to talk you out of all your illusions. By and large, my philosophy is Live and let live: if you’re enjoying the Matrix, go crazy.</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>8. How Thoughts Think Themselves</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1692
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Curiosity is a gift, a capacity of pleasure in knowing.”</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1700
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Whether curiosity is more like a desperate hunger or a delightful lure seems to depend on how directly and urgently relevant it is to our interests as defined by natural selection; the less direct and urgent the connection, the more subtle and pleasant the feeling.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1710
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Every thought has a propellant, and that propellant is emotional.”</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1749
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>In a famous sutra called The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving, the Buddha says that a “mind object”— a category that includes thoughts— is just like a taste or a smell: whether a person is “tasting a flavor with the tongue” or “smelling an odor with the nose” or “cognizing a mind object with the mind,” the person “lusts after it if it is pleasing” and “dislikes it if it is unpleasing.”</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>9. “Self” Control</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1812
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Brain-scan studies have shown that the same parts of the brain that mediate physical pain also mediate the pain of social rejection. Which helps explain why opiates and other painkillers can take the sting out of social setbacks. Even extended doses of Tylenol, one study showed, can dull the pain of social rejection.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1831
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Reason alone,” Hume argued, “can never oppose passion in the direction of the will.” Nothing “can oppose or retard the impulse of passion but a contrary impulse.”</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>10. Encounters with the Formless</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2183
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Her job is to teach liberation, and at that moment she was my teacher. Besides, she seemed to think that nothing does more good for the world than a truly liberated being— not even an unliberated author who steers others in the general direction of liberation.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2191
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Deeply embedded in Buddhist thought is the intrinsic moral value of sentient life— not just the value of human beings but the value of all organisms that have subjective experience and so are capable of pain and pleasure, of suffering and not suffering. And this value in turn imparts value to other things, such as helping people, being kind to dogs, and so on. Moral meaning is, in that sense, inherent in life.</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>11. The Upside of Emptiness</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2441
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>He answered, “But it’s a much cleaner perception. If I’m tasting a glass of wine and I’m trying to impress some restaurant critics or some friend who’s a great wine fancier, then I may have a story going, I may have an expectation for how this wine should be and how I should expect it to taste, and so it really blocks my clear, simple perception.  .  .  . So by getting this thought out of the way, this emotional thought out of the way, I have a much higher likelihood of directly perceiving whatever the sensation is.”</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2454
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Maybe the reason babies get so immersed in shapes and textures is because they haven’t yet developed their filing system, their sense of essence. In other words, they don’t yet “know” what the “things” surrounding them are, so the world is a wonderland of exploration. And maybe this helps explain how Weber could say that “emptiness” is actually “full”: sometimes not seeing essence lets you get drawn into the richness of things.</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>13. Like, Wow, Everything Is One (at Most)</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2836
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Between what a man calls me and what he simply calls mine the line is difficult to draw.” In that sense, he observed, “our immediate family is</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2980
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>There is a sense of dissolution of the bounds of self and an ensuing sense of continuity with the world out there. If you’re Buddhist (at least, a Buddhist of the mainstream type), you’re encouraged to think of that as a continuity of emptiness; and if you’re a Hindu, you’re encouraged to think of it as a continuity of soul or spirit.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3089
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>The refrain warns people to avoid the “three poisons” of raga, dvesha, and moha. Those three words are typically translated as “greed, hatred, and delusion,”</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>14. Nirvana in a Nutshell</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3163
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“It is here in this space between feeling and craving that the battle will be fought which will determine whether bondage will continue indefinitely into the future or whether it will be replaced by enlightenment and liberation. For if instead of yielding to craving, to the driving thirst for pleasure, if a person contemplates with mindfulness and awareness the nature of feelings and understands these feelings as they are, then that person can prevent craving from crystallizing and solidifying.”</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3180
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>conditions— from chains of causation that otherwise shackle you. The things in your environment— the sights, the sounds, the smells, the people, the news, the videos— are pushing your buttons, activating feelings that, however subtly, set in motion trains of thought and reaction that govern your behavior, sometimes in ways that are unfortunate. And they will keep doing that unless you start paying attention to what’s going on.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3183
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>This has been the point of much of this book. The human brain is a machine designed by natural selection to respond in pretty reflexive fashion to the sensory input impinging on it. It is designed, in a certain sense, to be controlled by that input. And a key cog in the machinery of control is the feelings that arise in response to the input. If you interact with those feelings via tanha— via the natural, reflexive thirst for the pleasant feelings and the natural, reflexive aversion to the unpleasant feelings— you will continue to be controlled by the world around you. But if you observe those feelings mindfully rather than just reacting to them, you can in some measure escape the control; the causes that ordinarily shape your behavior can be defied, and you can get closer to the unconditioned.</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3216
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Consider the idea of not-self: what we call the “self” is in such constant causal interaction with its environment, is so pervasively influenced by the world out there, as to raise doubts about how firm the boundaries of the self— and, for that matter, the core of the self— really are. Remember how the Buddha emphasized, in that original not-self sermon, that the various things we think of as parts of our self are in fact not under our control? The reason they’re not under our control is that— until we’re liberated, at least— they’re under the control of outside forces: they’re conditioned. And remember the Buddha’s emphasis on the impermanence of the things we think of as parts of the self? This too— the perennial arising and passing away of thoughts, emotions, attitudes— is a consequence of the ever-changing forces that act on us, forces that set off chain reactions inside us. The things inside us are subject to causes, to conditions— and it is the fate of all conditioned things to change when conditions change. And conditions change pretty much all the time.</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>15. Is Enlightenment Enlightening?</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3326
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>Well, from natural selection’s point of view, this is heresy. If there’s one idea that natural selection has built into me, it’s that I have distinctive interests and should focus on them. On those occasions when some of my interests overlap with the interests of others, then fine, we can do business; but if there’s no such overlap, my interests take priority.</h3>
    <h2 class='sectionHeading'>16. Meditation and the Unseen Order</h2>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3579
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>“Monks, true knowledge is the forerunner in the entry upon wholesome states, with a sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing following along.”</h3>
    <h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3808
  </div>
  <div class='noteText'>evidence in favor of it. This three-part alignment— the alignment of metaphysical truth and moral truth and happiness— is embodied in the richly ambiguous word that lies at the heart of Buddhist practice: dharma.</h3>
